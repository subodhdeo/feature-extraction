Feature extraction of Tabla strokes.

Audio features plays an important role in classification process. Here, I have demonsrated the method to extract zero crossing rate and spectral centroid feature of a Tabla strokes. 
Tabla plays a very important role in Hindustani music which is very popular and cultural oriented tradition of Indian music.
The feature extraction process can help to create machine listening system where machine could be able to recognise various strokes played on Tabla.
